Given that a solution for vision-based navigation (VBN) in a free-flying robot has limited resources (size, power, computation), there is a possibility that pose estimation will not meet the required accuracy, resulting in poor performance for some 0g robotics research tasks.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.5
Given that avionics and fans make noise, there is a possibility that the desired Astrobee design will not meet ISS safety standards, resulting in either it not being certified for operations on ISS, or a fan design with low noise but inferior performance will be used.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.25	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.25
Given the serial Prototyping and Flight development efforts, there is a possibility that the flight unit delivery will be delayed. Any delay in delivery will reduce the time available to perform on-orbit commissioning work in FY19.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.5	0	0	0

Transitioning from a technology demonstration to an operational system is a significant challenge. Successfully performing a task without crew intervention and also reducing crew workload is critical to proving the utility of R2. A key risk is that R2 will not be robust enough to operate repeatedly without crew intervention (e.g., system reboots).	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
Developing robust path planning and obstacle avoidance software algorithms is a major challenge. Creating software to parameterize possible grasps will also be key to developing a supervisory control interface that is easily adaptable to real time situations. The risk is that R2â€™s safety control and monitoring system limits its capabilities, reducing its effectiveness and ability to quickly respond to on-orbit requests for support. 	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
HET2 will perform risk management in accordance with NPR 8000.4A (Agency Risk Management Procedural Requirements). HET2 will use Continuous Risk Management to identify, track and mitigate risks. Each HET2 Element will develop and maintain a Risk List, which will describe the risk #, description, likelihood by consequence (LxC) score, handling strategy (mitigate, watch, accept, etc.), action plan (contingency or mitigation plan) and status. The risk lists will be reviewed monthly and updated to reflect newly identified risks, assessment-ranking changes, and status of the respective mitigation plans. The top Project Risks and status will be reported in the quarterly report.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The costs and schedule for this project were planned with a resources loaded schedule that includes appropriate reserves commensurate with project phase and risk. With that said, unforeseen challenges may arise in any advanced technology project that exhaust planned resources. In these cases the project will submit at Change Request to the GCD Program to request additional resources and/or reduce project scope.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The major challenges and risks associated with Astrobee validation and testing parallel the same risks in Astrobee development. Astrobee will need meet the success criteria established for the requirements and technical challenges in design and development. Further, the test results will be presented to the PSRP for ISS certification.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

The BN-2 ISS Kick-off meeting was completed in February and the draft Payload Integration Agreement (PIA) has been uploaded to the OZ Requirements Baseline and Integration Tool (ORBIT). A CEF to approve the PIA is currently open and review is expected to complete by the end of the March. The BN-1 flight experiment agreement with BioServe to use the SABL incubator for on-orbit runs 4-6 was approved and a kickoff meeting was held March 12. A similar agreement covering use of SABL for BN-2 was approved on March 1. 	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
